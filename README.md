# Weird Salads

From the look at the requirements main features it needs to make it a useful application are below I will approach them in that order. 


1. User authentication
2. Inventory Managment 
3. Recipe Builder
4. Point of Sale 


## User authentication

I will use the django abstract user and add a location id and a couple more flags to use if needed. The location id will allow me to filter per locations.
